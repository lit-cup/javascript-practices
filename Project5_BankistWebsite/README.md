# Bankist Website

A modern, interactive banking landing page demo. This project demonstrates advanced DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI effects using vanilla JavaScript and CSS.

## Features

- **Modal Window:** Open and close modal for account creation.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Scroll to sections with smooth animation.
- **Page Navigation:** Efficient navigation using event delegation.
- **Tabbed Operations:** Switch between different banking operations.
- **Menu Fade Animation:** Navigation menu fades on hover.
- **Sticky Navigation:** Navigation bar sticks to the top on scroll.
- **Section Reveal:** Sections animate in as you scroll.
- **Lazy Loading Images:** Images load as they enter the viewport.
- **Slider:** Testimonial slider with arrows and dots navigation.

## Main Files

- `index.html` – Main HTML structure.
- `style.css` – All styles and layout.
- `script.js` – JavaScript for all interactive features.
- `DOM-Event.js` – Practice file for DOM selection, events, and traversing.

## Notable JavaScript Concepts

- Event delegation and propagation
- Intersection Observer API for sticky nav, section reveal, and lazy loading
- DOM traversing and manipulation
- Efficient script loading (`defer`, `async`)
- Creating, inserting, and removing DOM elements

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Explore the navigation, open the modal, scroll, and interact with the slider and tabs.
3. Review `script.js` and `DOM-Event.js` for learning advanced DOM and event techniques.

## Notes

- This page is **not responsive** by default.
- All images and icons are for demo/learning purposes.
- Inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course.
