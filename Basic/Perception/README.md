# Perception — JavaScript Fundamentals and Tooling

This folder contains short demos and notes that illustrate core JavaScript concepts and common tooling used in modern development.

## Topics covered
- npm usage and basic command-line workflows (scripts, install, run).
- CLI usage examples for running demos and build tools.
- Bundlers and dev tools: brief demos using Parcel and Vite.
- Async/await behavior and top-level async patterns:
  - async functions always return a Promise.
  - await yields the resolved value of a Promise.
- Module patterns and module systems:
  - ES Modules (native): import / export syntax for public API.
  - CommonJS: module.exports / require (example: musiclist.js).
  - Revealing module pattern and IIFE are shown as legacy patterns for encapsulation.
- Demo babel to polyfill modern JS features for older browsers

## What you'll find in this folder
- Small demos that explain async/await and top-level async.
- Example files demonstrating module usage (ESM and CommonJS).
- Minimal bundler examples using Parcel and Vite to show workflow differences.
