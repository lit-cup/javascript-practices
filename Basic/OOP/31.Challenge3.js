/* 
1. Use a constructor function to implement an Electric Car (called EV) as a CHILD "class" of Car. 
Besides a make and current speed, the EV also has the current battery charge in % ('charge' property);
2. Implement a 'chargeBattery' method which takes an argument 'chargeTo' and sets the battery charge to 'chargeTo';
3. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 20, 
    and decrease the charge by 1%. Then log a message like this: 'Tesla going at 140 km/h, with a charge of 22%';
4. Create an electric car object and experiment with calling 'accelerate', 'brake' and 'chargeBattery' (charge to 90%). 
    Notice what happens when you 'accelerate'! HINT: Review the definiton of polymorphism ðŸ˜‰

DATA CAR 1: 'Tesla' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

/**
 * The steps:
 * create a constructor function for the car class
 * create a constructor function for the electric car class (EV) that inherits from the car class by call()
 * link the prototypes of the two classes using Object.create()
 * implement the methods for the car class (accelerate and brake)
 * implement the methods for the electric car class (chargeBattery and overwriting accelerate)
 * create an instance of the electric car class and test the methods
 * should be notice linking the prototypes and the constructor property and how polymorphism works
